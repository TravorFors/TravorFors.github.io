# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biography
I am now an undergraduate student majoring in biomedical engineering. TravorFors is my cc98 ID. Forsyth is a character in the novel Lord of Secrecy, whose profession is a traveller. The cc98 website restrict the length of IDs to 10 bit so I built up a word from 'Traveller' and 'Forsyth'. 

I set up this personal website mainly for the goal of having a proper management of my projects. The website is helping me linking up all my works under a shared goal of giving valuable solution to several problems. I am willing to express my sincere thanks to all of you click into this website. Thanks for your attention of my half-baked academic recognitions and possible wills to follow up my work. Hopefully what I write on this website can come out with some help on what we may both feel confused with all along.

Some of my academic writings (either in class or during my reading) will also be updated on this website. The writings I put on this website will be the ones I regard useful to the field. I love writing with paper and pen, so most of the writings will be updated in the form of drafts. Most of the writings has uploaded to the cc98 bbs of Zhejiang University (www.cc98.org) and I will re-edit these document with LaTeX as long as they get enough feedback.

# üî• Research Topics

Currently my research mainly focus on Medical Image Analysis. <br />

*A winter night when I was five years old, my mom served me a bowl of carp soup. I raised a problem to her: Is it true that the interosseous bones of every fish grow in exactly the same place? <br />

Over thousands of years, orthopedic surgeons have figured out the shape, structure, and growth position of every bone in the human body. For a healthy person, bones should always be where they should be to meet the demands of the corresponding functions. Each of them might be different in a small statistical interval in space, but the structure should always be the same. We may say that, within the margin of error, every human bone 'grows in the same place'. <br />

However, in other fields of medicine, the structure might be less quantified under the modern perspective. Medical students still memorize the anatomical atlases in a qualitative point of view. Just like small interosseous spines of the carp in the bowl, some of the un-quantified structures may 'stuck you' in the way to better understandings of body functions or better treatments to diseases. Brain structure analysis was one of the fields which was famous for demands of higher space-resolution, more modern mathematical tools. We can see that neurobiologists were always the firsts to recognize this problem. As medicine advances, physicians will also develop a need for a more refined and quantitative understanding of anatomical structure and function. For example, diagnosis of early cancer or metastases calls for a dynamic, more elaborate analysis of tissue structures, circulation and functions of immune system (which is one of my current research interest). <br />

From my point of view, medical imaging can build up a link between the structure and the physic laws. Functional imaging re-defined what imaging approaches can do since 1990s. Machine learning methods, on the other hand, are considered by most of the pioneers in the field to be leading a second revolution in imaging. As beginners to the field, I place myself as a learner and a consolidator of the knowledges. I may use the cross-field knowledges to reveal the unsolved, only developing something new when needed to come over the obstacles in the journey. <br />

These days, my surveys and projects are mainly centered around these two main threads: <br />

- Cortex Analysis: transfer of critical points.  <br />
  *I am a fan of Karl J. Friston although I never hold a firm belief in his free energy principle. However, if possible, I believe such kind of skeleton should either be proved true or falsified by novel MIA approach.  <br />
  
- Tumor Metastasis Prediction: Pathway imaging & reconstruction, 3D Bio-modeling  <br />
  *What's the difference of imaging and modeling? From my perspective, modeling is the process of attaching 'what we predict' to 'what we see'. For individuals, modeling will be more based on imaging rather than anatomical dissection. If biomedical engineers want to raise up more accurate ways for doctors to diagnosis or design treatment programs by modeling a patient, imaging is always the first way. As a result, for bio-geeks, developing imaging approaches under the goal of 'modeling someone' will be an attractive task. For biomedical engineers, that means developing imaging approaches specified for some medical missions.
